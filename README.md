# PiTemp 
A Raspberry Pi 3 based temperature, humidity and alerting system. Pitemp uses multiple DHT11 sensors to take readings and sends metrics back to a broker using the MQtt protocol. PiTemp is a work in progress and is completly open source. Please feel free to use the code and architecture to build your own projects.

## Software Libraries needed
All of the codeing for PiTemp is done using Python3. The reason I chose Python to build PiTemp is because it is easy to understand and can be picked up easily. It isalso one of the mpost popular programming langauges around, and can be used to build everything from simple scripts to machine learning alrorythems.

# Part 2 - Build the PiTemp
## Set up the PiTemp
The following bash script will install everything needed to develop and run the PiTemp code.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#make sure you have the certificate before setting up.

#The certificate needed to connect to the broker.
#In this project we will generate the certificates on our example broker.
CERT='ca.crt'
CERTPATH='~/pitemp/certs'

#Update the underlying libraries.
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get upgrade

#Install all of the Python 3 components
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip
sudo apt install -y python3-dev
sudo apt install -y python-imaging python-smbus i2c-tools
sudo apt install -y python3-pil
sudo apt install -y python3-setuptools

#Upgrade the setup tools
sudo pip3 install --upgrade setuptools

#Enable SPI on the RPi
sudo `echo 'dtoverlay=spi1-3cs' `>> /boot/config.txt

#Install the needed Python3 libraries
sudo pip3 install RPI.GPIO
sudo pip3 install adafruit-blinka
sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-dht
sudo pip3 install schedule
sudo pip3 install pysqlite3

sudo apt install -y python-smbus
sudo apt-get install -y libgpiod2
sudo apt install -y i2c-tools

#copy the ca.crt file to the correct location
sudo mkdir -p ${CERTPATH}
sudo cp ${CERT} ${CERTPATH}
```

## Build a simple broker
In order to develop and test the PiTemp and the MQTT protocol, you will need to deploy a simple broker to recive the data sent by the PiTemp. The MQTT protocol uses SSL to protect data, and as a best practice should be used in IoT communication channels. The MQTT protocol is used in IoT applications because of it speed and the fault tolerant nature of the protocol.

SCALE = os.getenv('SCALE',None)

#The GPIO pins to use for sensors
PINS = os.getenv('PINS',None)

# Part 3 - How it works 
## Hardware Components
### DHT11
Per elprocus.com, The DHT11 sensor consists of a capacitive humidity sensing element and a thermistor for sensing temperature.  The humidity sensing capacitor has two electrodes with a moisture holding substrate as a dielectric between them. Change in the capacitance value occurs with the change in humidity levels. The IC measure, process this changed resistance values and change them into digital form.

For measuring temperature this sensor uses a Negative Temperature coefficient thermistor, which causes a decrease in its resistance value with increase in temperature. To get larger resistance value even for the smallest change in temperature, this sensor is usually made up of semiconductor ceramics or polymers.

The temperature range of DHT11 is from 0 to 50 degree Celsius with a 2-degree accuracy. Humidity range of this sensor is from 20 to 80% with 5% accuracy. The sampling rate of this sensor is 1Hz .i.e. it gives one reading for every second.  DHT11 is small in size with operating voltage from 3 to 5 volts. The maximum current used while measuring is 2.5mA.

### SSD1306 OLED
The ssd1306 OLED screen is a 128x64 display and is ideal for smal projects. The screen can be easily hooked up to either an Arduino or Raspberry PI using the SPI output on the GPIO.

### Raspberry PI 3
One of the most popular single board computers which is powerful enough for any hobby project and comes in at a very affordable price point. The main features of the board are 64bit, quad core ARM CPU, 1Gb of ram, 802.11 a/b ethernet, and HDMI video output. The board can be set up very quickly by flashing the Raspberry PI OS to a micro SD card, and powering on the board.

## Protocols
### MQTT Protocol
MQTT is a lightweight publish/subscribe messaging protocol designed for M2M (machine to machine) telemetry in low bandwidth environments.
